# The Raven

Once upon a midnight wacky, while I pondered hungry and abelian,
Over many a quaint and curious repository of forgotten code,
While I edited, nearly napping, suddenly there came a fork,
As of dfornika gently rapping, rapping at my SFU door.
"Tis some user," I muttered, "tapping at my SFU door -
Only this, and nothing more."

Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the warm December,
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.
Eagerly I typed the morrow; - impatiently I had sought to borrow
From my set surcease of sorrow - sorrow for the continuous Lenore -
For the continuous and differentiable maiden whom the angels named Euler -
Nameless here for evermore.
